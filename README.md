The **DMAVA** provides a complete setup for running **Autoware** and **AWSIM Labs** in a multi-host, multi-vehicle simulation environment for **autonomous vehicles**.  

It enables simulation of multiple autonomous vehicles across different physical machines while maintaining synchronized perception, localization, planning, and control pipelines.

## Features

- Distributed simulation across multiple hosts
- Zenoh-based ROS 2 topic synchronization
- Multi-vehicle coordination with namespaced topics for collision avoidance
- Modular design enabling integration of new perception, planning, or control components
- Scalable to larger fleets and more complex simulation scenarios
