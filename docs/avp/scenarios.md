# AVP Scenarios

## 1) Goal Navigation
- Set `2D Pose Estimate` for each vehicle in RViz.
- Use **Goal** for distinct destinations.
- Engage; observe both vehicles navigating without conflict.

## 2) Parking Maneuver
- Assign goals inside parking polygons.
- AVP manager allocates free spots (based on your detector).
- Vehicles park and mark spots as occupied.

If environment setup is needed, see **Framework → Multi-Vehicle Simulation**.
